# Student-Performance
Predicting the percentage of a student on the basis of number of hours they studied. In this we will se how python scikit-learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score on the basis of number of hours they studied.This is a simple linear regression task that involve only two variables
